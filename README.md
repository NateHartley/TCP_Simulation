# TCP Stack Simulation

Simplified TCP Stack project for the purposes of understanding fundamental networking principles and protocols.

Features of this project:
- TCP flags (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Connection states (e.g. SYN-SENT, ESTABLISHED)
- Sending and receiving data between server and client
- Simulating TCP packet structure

To run, execute the following commands in two separate terminals:

Server terminal<br>
`python3 server.py`

Client terminal<br>
`python3 client.py`

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Server file must be running before the client file is ran.
